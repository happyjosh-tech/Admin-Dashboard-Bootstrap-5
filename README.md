# Admin-Dashboard-Bootstrap-5
#Getting started
#Git clone or download the project files
#Have fun developing!

# Sections include
#A navigation bar with user settings;
#A sidebar with navigation items;
#A section to show the title, tagline, and breadcrumbs for the current page;
#The main content area with a couple of widget cards;
#Lastly, a footer.

I utilized inline css but feel free to use any method that suite you right.
